SAB-DE is a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA) designed for solving expensive constrained optimization problems (ECOPs).
It has a bilevel architecture, the lower-level aims to adjust lower-level variables to satisfy constraints, while the upper-level works on optimizing upper-level variables to minimize the objective.
The division of upper-level and lower-level variables depends on the impact of these variables on solution feasibility.
The variables with significant impacts on solution feasibility have larger probability to be allocated to lower-level.
